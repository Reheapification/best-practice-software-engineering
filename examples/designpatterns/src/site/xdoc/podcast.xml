            We have recorded some enhanced podcasts with projects teams that used this webiste as the basis for their Projects at the Vienna University of Technology, specifically the BPSE-Basic Example. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently only in German, but English material might follow soon.

        <p>
            An enhanced podcast is actually an audio recording with additional pictures and links. This is why the podcasts are provided in m4a format not mp3. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            The podcast collection consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recordings from lectures</li>
            <li>Slides are recorded parallel to the audio, hence the slide presented to the text can be seen in parallel</li>
            <li>Each Slide change is also a "chapter", i.e., slides can be easily skipped or specific parts addressed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This also means, that some Podcast recordings were <i>not</i> made in a studio-kind of setup, but live before audience</p>
