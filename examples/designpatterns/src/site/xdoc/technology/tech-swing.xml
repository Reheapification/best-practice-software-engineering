		  <p>Swing (another name for the "Java Foundation Classes") is a Java class library provided as part of Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 
		    to support building graphics user interface (GUI) and graphics functionality for client applications. Swing provides a modern look &amp; feel on many
		    platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS.</p>

		<subsection name="Configuration">
		  <p>Since Swing is part of the Java 2 Software Development Kit, no configuration is necessary.</p>

		  <p>A lot of information around Swing can be found at</p>

          <p>Swing is a large library and this is not the place to introduce into the development of GUIs with Swing.</p>
		  
		  <p>If you are unfamiliar with Swing, you should work through <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">this tutorial</a>.</p>
		  
		  <p>Since Swing is part of the J2SE Development Kit, the API documentation can be found in the J2SE JavaDoc, e.g. for Version 6 at: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.htmll">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html</a>.</p>
