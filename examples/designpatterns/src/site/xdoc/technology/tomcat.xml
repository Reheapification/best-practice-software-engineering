                <p>
                    Tomcat is a very popular container and server for 
                    Java web applications and is being developed by a large
                    community of the 
                    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> (ASF). 
                    It enjoys great popularity
                    in ecomomic and scientific disciplines and is considered to be
                    robust, reliable and high-performant. In Java enterprise applications, it
                    is mostly part of a J2EE application server like 
                    <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openejb/">OpenEJB</a>,
                    <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org/">Geronimo</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.jboss.com/">JBoss</a> or
                    <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">Glassfish</a> and handles
                    incoming requests to deployed web applications. Tomcat can also
                    be used as module of an
                    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a> 
                    (other modules exist for CGI or PHP support). Nevertheless,
                    it is increasingly used as standalone web server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Tomcat is started as web server it will be bound to the specific 
                    TCP/IP address of the running computer and 
                    identified by a preconfigured port address where it is listening for
                    incoming user requests. The transfer protocol on which requests 
                    are based is the 
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/">HTTP protocol</a>
                    which allows to access any
                    web application via web browser. The aim of the web container is
                    to forward the requests to the intended web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Various versions of Apache Tomcat are available which differ in
                    the underlying architecture. Apache Tomcat implements the Java
                    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/servlet/index.html">Servlet</a>/
                    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jsp/index.html">JSP</a>
                    specifications and each major version implements
                    another specification whereas minor versions are mostly bugfixing and 
                    maintainance versions. E.g. both Tomcat versions 5.0 and 5.5 implement
                    the Sun Servlet/JSP specifications 2.4/2.0 whereas version 6.0 implements the
                    Servlet/JSP specifications 2.5/2.1 which lead to a significant jump
                    in functionality.
                    Further, each tomcat version is spitted into various modules that
                    provide additional functionality, e.g, administration and monitoring modules and 
                    must be downloaded and installed separately. To run Tomcat as web container and
                    server, the <em>Core</em> distribution is needed.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Windows installation">
                <p>
                    If you use Windows, you can download the <em>Windows Server Installer</em>
                    version of the <em>Core</em> distribution. The installation is straight-forward.
                    You should only take care, that the installation path to the Tomcat directory
                    contains no whitespaces because then errors can occur when starting 
                    Tomcat as web server. 
                    We recommend a path something like that: <code>C:\Programme\Apache\Tomcat</code>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The installation path to your Tomcat is referred to as CATALINA_HOME and is
                    usually set as user/system variable. You can check this by opening the command prompt 
                    (Start, Ausfuehren and type <code>cmd</code> followed by pressing enter). Then type 
                    <code>echo %CATALINA_HOME%</code> and press enter. This
                    command will print the installation path to your Tomcat directory on the console
                    if CATALINA_HOME is set as user/system variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Tomcat was successfully installed, you should notice a new icon
                    in the Windows System Tray. With the help of this icon, you can
                    start, stop and configure Tomcat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you started the server using the default configuration, you should be able to access
                    the web server via URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favourite
                    web browser. 
                </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Download the binary version, e.g. as <em>tar.gz</em>
                            or <em>zip</em>, of the
                            <em>Core</em> distribution.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extract it to a directory of your choice 
                            (e.g. extracting Tomcat version 5.5 to /opt/programs/ should result in a 
                            directoy /opt/programs/apache-tomcat-5.5)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Change your directory to <code>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/</code> and type as
                            root <code>touch 90environment</code>. Then edit the file
                            <code>90environment</code> with your favourite text editor and
                            insert the following:
                            <source>
#installation path to our tomcat directory, 
#in our example we use 5.5
#Please set TOMCAT_HOME to your Tomcat installation directory    
TOMCAT_HOME="/opt/programs/apache-tomcat-5.5"    
CATALINA_HOME=$TOMCAT_HOME
                                
export TOMCAT_HOME CATALINA_HOME
                                
# path to our java installation directory
#the following uncommented 3 lines must be done if
#the 'javac' command is not found in the terminal
#Please set JAVA_HOME to your Java SDK directory!!
JAVA_HOME='/usr/java'
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:PATH
export PATH JAVA_HOME
</source>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Restart the operating system.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have done the previous steps, you should be able
                    to start Tomcat by typing <code>$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh</code>
                    followed by pressing enter. If Tomcat is really running,
                    the URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> 
                    displays the Tomcat welcome page in any webbrowser of your choice.
                    To stop Tomcat, you can use the command 
                    <code>$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh</code>.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Configuration">
                <p>
                    The <strong><em>configuration files</em></strong> of Tomcat are located in the
                    <code>CATALINA_HOME/conf</code> directory and allow
                    to change a couple of security settings.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Changing default port 8080 to any other</strong>:
                            <br/>
                            Edit the file <code>server.xml</code> in the
                            <code>CATALINA_HOME/conf</code> directory
                            with your favourite text editor. Find the
                            <code>Connector</code> element in the XML file and change 
                            the <code>port</code> attribute value
                            to your preferred port number. (It should not be a port number
                            less than 1024 because they are reserved for other applications
                            except you really know what you do;) ). E.g. the default 
                            <code>Connector</code> element can look like this:
                            <source>
&lt;!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 -->
&lt;Connector port="8080" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100"
connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" />
                            </source>
                            Then you can change the port to 8089 on which
                            Tomcat is listening for requests.
                            <source>
&lt;!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 -->
&lt;Connector port="8089" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100"
connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" />
                            </source>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Setting username and password for Tomcat Manager</strong>:
                            <br/>
                            Edit the file <code>tomcat-user.xml</code> in the
                            <code>CATALINA_HOME/conf</code> directory
                            with your favourite text editor and add a new user with the role 
                            'manager' and optionally 'tomcat'.
                            <source>
&lt;user username="Hugo" password="Boss" roles="manager,tomcat"/>
                            </source>
                            Now you can use the Tomcat Manager in your web browser with 
                            the username Hugo and the password Boss.
                        </li>

                    of these files can be very useful if errors occur
                    during the deployment of your web application as well
                    as during it's execution.
