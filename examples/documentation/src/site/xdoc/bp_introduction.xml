  	    <section name="Best Practices: Software Patterns and Technologies">
            <p>
            This part of the documentation provides two sections: <a href="patterns.html">Software Patterns</a> will explain general solution strategies for common engineering problems. We explain mainly patterns that are also used in the examples. Check out the example documentation to get a reference which patterns are used in which example.
            </p>
            <p>
            The second section: <a href="technology.html">Technology</a>, gives an overview on the used technologies. This should not be mistaken with a tutorial to the according technologies! The purpose of the technology section is, to get a brief idea why a specific technology is used and what the general usage patterns are. Additional references are provided to get detailed information.
            </p>
            <p>
            We recommend to start reading with the example documentation, then start reading the code to get an initial overview on the example application and follow up in this section to get an in-depth understanding of technologies and patterns. Eventually go back into the sources and try to understand the details of the implementations.
